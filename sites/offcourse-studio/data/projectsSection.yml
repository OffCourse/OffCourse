  - title: Bots with an Attitude
    description: |
      For [Planet B](https://planet-b.eu/), we are developing a support system
      for Artistic Researchers who are either working with Machine Learning and
      AI, or want to learn it. The Bots from the project's title function as
      personal assistant who can perform up to three tasks. However, their
      personality is random and outside the scope of control of its creator. 
  - title: Public Badges
    description: |
      For a [coalition](www.publicspaces.net) most of the Netherlands major
      public and cultural institutions, I developed a solution to reduce
      their dependency on major commercial internet platforms (such as facebook
      and google). In order to achieve this, I came up with a badges system
      that values the ethical values of internet product and services and makes
      them visible on their website. 
  - title: Offcourse 
    description: |
      This is the non-profit I founded after I left academia. Its focus is to
      democratize education by blurring the lines between teaching and learning.
      It's main premise is that everything you want to learn nowadays is already
      available online. The only thing you need is someone or something that can
      show you where to look.
  - title: Coding the humanities
    description: |
      A program at the University of Amsterdam that implements new unlimited
      practices of digital literacy, while challenging situated knowledges.
      This helps students and researchers to understand the various
      technologically mediated objects that they are studying. Developing
      custom tools, rather than using ready-made ones, can improve the actual
      practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and quality) of
      its output.
