  - title: Bots with an Attitude
    description: |
      Bots with an attitude is a project for Planet B from Waag. Planet B is a
      mission to recolonise planet Earth based on a narrative of DIY expeditions
      to a fictional planet. The project ‘Bots with an attitude’ is a support
      system for artistic researchers, who work or wish to work with machine
      learning and AI. The bots are personal assistants. They help by gathering
      information or helping publish the artist's work. However, they are unusual
      bots, because they have a character and mind of their own, leading to
      unexpected encounters and, hopefully, productive surprises.
  - title: Public Badges
    description: |
      PublicSpaces is alternative platform for social interaction. Nineteen
      prominent parties from the Dutch media, culture, education and health
      sectors – such as media production company VPRO, research collective Waag
      and cultural center Pakhuis de Zwijger, research the possibility to
      reclaim the internet as a common good and minimize our dependence upon
      commercial platforms, such as Facebook and Google. Offcourse Studio
      developed a badges system that certifies the ethical values of internet
      products and services.
  - title: Offcourse 
    description: |
      Offcourse is a platform by Offcourse Studio. Offcourse is an open source
      platform for online learning. The Internet is an endless source of
      knowledge; blogs, video tutorials or even that one interesting podcast.
      We developed a platform that allows people to gather the best sources
      online and structure them into easy-shareable courses. This helps people
      to get started with crowdlearning; sharing what they have learned and
      learning that others have shared.
  - title: Coding the humanities
    description: |
      Coding the Humanities was one of the first coding bootcamps in the
      Netherlands. It was designed for the Humanities Department of the
      University of Amsterdam. During a month-long full time program, students
      and researchers worked together to understand various technologically
      mediated objects and develop custom tools for research. Developing these
      tools themselves, improved the students’ practice of humanities research,
      because it gave them insight in the choices that were made both in the
      construction of the object as well as in their own analysis.
  - title: Augmenting Masterpieces
    description: |
      Augmenting Masterpieces was a collaborative research project by the
      University of Amsterdam and the Rijksmuseum. The project aimed to augment
      the visitor experience by using beacons. Visitors used an app to discover
      what other visitors had previously said about the artworks. This added a
      social layer to their visit to the Rijksmuseum. Offcourse Studio's
      Jan Hein Hoogstad initiated and coordinated the project. Johanna Barnbeck
      performed the research and the prototype was developed by the digital
      innovation agency UncInc. The project was nominated for a Best of the Web'
      award.
