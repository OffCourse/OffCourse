  evidence to the user that the organization has the intention to implement the
  Public Spaces values in their online presence.

Scenario: Badge is Publicly Visible on Website
  Given a user wants to know if the organization subscribes to the Public Spaces Manifesto
  And visits the organizations homepage
  When the user scrolls to the footer of the page
  Then the user should see the Zero Badge
  And the Badge should be displayed with sufficient color contrast
  And the Badge should have sufficient padding around it

  Given a user wants to know what the Public Spaces manifesto entails
  And visits the website of an affiliated organization
