  Maintaining a healthy online community is a gargantuan task. Maybe even too 
  much work for a organization of your size. Trolls constantly appear out of 
  nowhere, your contributors often talk off topic, and your most loyal members 
  are mean to newcomers. Moderation is laborious and thus expensive. But what 
  if you would approach governance differently? Rather than policing individual 
  transgressions, Offcourse suggests an holistic approach to govern your community.
