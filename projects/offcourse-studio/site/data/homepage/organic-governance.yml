  Maintaining a healthy online community is a gargantuan task. Maybe even too 
  much work for a organization of your size. Trolls constantly appear out of 
  nowhere, your contributors often talk off topic, and your most loyal members 
  are mean to newcomers. Moderation is laborious and thus expensive. But what 
  if you would approach governance differently? Rather than policing individual 
  transgressions, Offcourse suggests an holistic approach to govern your community.

  title: Bots with an Attitude
  description: |
      Bots with an attitude is a project for Planet B from Waag. Planet B is a
      mission to recolonise planet Earth based on a narrative of DIY expeditions
      to a fictional planet. The project ‘Bots with an attitude’ is a support
      system for artistic researchers, who work or wish to work with machine
      learning and AI. The bots are personal assistants. They help by gathering
      information or helping publish the artist's work. However, they are unusual
      bots, because they have a character and mind of their own, leading to
      unexpected encounters and, hopefully, productive surprises.
