  Your organization is driven by values. Though making money is important, 
  it is far from the only thing that drives you. But it is difficult to 
  communicate the things that are valuable to you: to customers, partners, 
  but also to your own team. Offcourse transforms your values into measurable, 
  common goals. We put your ethics into practice.

      PublicSpaces is an alternative platform for social interaction. Nineteen
      prominent parties from the Dutch media, culture, education and health
      sectors â€“ such as media production company VPRO, research collective Waag
      and cultural center Pakhuis de Zwijger, research the possibility to
      reclaim the internet as a common good and minimize our dependence upon
      commercial platforms, such as Facebook and Google. Offcourse Studio
      developed a badges system that certifies the ethical values of internet
      products and services.
