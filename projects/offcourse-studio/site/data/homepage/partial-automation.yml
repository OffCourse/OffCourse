  You heard the promise many times: our software will solve all your problems. 
  At Offcourse, we do not believe in generic, all encompassing solutions. Heck, 
  we don't even believe that all of your task should be automated. Many of them 
  require the knowledge and dedication that only you can give. Still, it's a 
  waste to continue to do the task that can by done by a machine manually. 
  Finding the right ways to automate your organization is a process of optimization. Offcourse is your guide through this process.

      Offcourse is a platform by Offcourse Studio. Offcourse is an open source
      platform for online learning. The Internet is an endless source of
      knowledge; blogs, video tutorials or even that one interesting podcast.
      We developed a platform that allows people to gather the best sources
      online and structure them into easy-shareable courses. This helps people
      to get started with crowdlearning; sharing what they have learned and
      learning that others have shared.
