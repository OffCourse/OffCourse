  You heard the promise many times: our software will solve all your problems. 
  At Offcourse, we do not believe in generic, all encompassing solutions. Heck, 
  we don't even believe that all of your task should be automated. Many of them 
  require the knowledge and dedication that only you can give. Still, it's a 
  waste to continue to do the task that can by done by a machine manually. 
  Finding the right ways to automate your organization is a process of optimization. Offcourse is your guide through this process.
