excerpt: | 
  The central premise of the Bots with an Attitude project, is that bots are 
  much more useful when they do not only talk to people, but also with each
  other. While researching bot frameworks to use, I discovered
  that they all have something strange in common. They don't allow bots to talk
  to each other. What a waste!

When [Chris Julien](https://twitter.com/chrisjulien) pitched the idea of
[Planet B](https://planet-b.eu/) to me, I was immediately sold. The premise of
the project is simple: What if we could start from scratch on a new
planet. How would we approach this? What instruments would we use? What habits would we
leave on the old planet?

My role in the landing team was to think of how the tools to work together could look
like. It was clear from the beginning that the team would be physically and
temporarily dispersed. But in order to Planet B did social distancing before it became all the
rage, and needed the tools to do so.
