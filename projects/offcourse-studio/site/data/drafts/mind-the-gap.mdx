   Discussions about fake news cover up a real crisis of information. In this

Through the miracles of the [early
internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LzyRcLJdlg), I discovered the [Weekly
World News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_World_News) in high school.
Journalism never was the same to me again. Why
[read](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49985/where-are-they-now-8-things-terrified-us-90s)
about the horrors of acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer, when there was
a newspaper that covered sightings of Marilyn Monroe and [Bat
Boy](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gdkwv/an-interview-with-the-creator-of-bat-boy-987)
instead?

Obviously, my own journalistic endeavors had to follow suit. Being the 
editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, I started to take inspiration from my
newly discovered favorite news source by blurring the lines between fact and
anecdotes. My piece de resistance: a [Dear Mary](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/dear-mary-your-problems-solved) 
item that featured letters from the teaching staff. 

Our Mary &mdash; named Hans &mdash; gave the English teacher some much needed
tough love about his financial problems, but was also warm and understanding when
the Gym teacher opened up about his sexually frustrations. Generoso Pope Jr.
would have been proud. Alas, the dean was of a different opinion. After
two marvelous issues, I was removed from my post. 

Although I was clearly not amused by their actions at the time, in retrospect, I
would argue that dean handled the problem of fake news in an exemplary
manner. The steps that here followed were as follows:

1. Associate fake news to an agent

2. Adjust the reputation score of the corresponding agent negatively

3. Remove the agent from discourse when its reputation drops below a treshhold

In fact, I believe that we should automate these steps and use them to
improve our online conversations.

Some of [today's
headlines](https://www.businessinsider.com/trinity-mirror-drop-in-print-advertising-newspapers-moving-digital-2017-6?r=US&IR=T)
could easily have featured on the cover of the Weekly World News. Discrediting
them on the basis of facts, however, has become next to impossible. Each filter
bubble has it's own set of facts to support their claim. 

So we need people to help us fact from fiction. And who is best equipped to do
so? Well, an expert in the relevant field, of course.

So experts haven't solved the problem of fake news, but merely shifted the
burden of proof. Rather
