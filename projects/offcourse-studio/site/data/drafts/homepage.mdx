# Value Driven Development

Creating solutions that map, organize, and add values to your organization


## Ethical Intelligence

Your organization is driven by values. Though making money is important, 
it is far from the only thing that drives you. But it is difficult to 
communicate the things that are valuable to you: to customers, partners, 
but also to your own team. Offcourse transforms your values into measurable, 
common goals. We put your ethics into practice. 


## Partial Automation

You heard the promise many times: our software will solve all your problems. 
At Offcourse, we do not believe in generic, all encompassing solutions. Heck, 
we don't even believe that all of your task should be automated. Many of them 
require the knowledge and dedication that only you can give. Still, it's a 
waste to continue to do the task that can by done by a machine manually. 
Finding the right ways to automate your organization is a process of optimization. Offcourse is your guide through this process.


## Organic Governance

Maintaining a healthy online community is a gargantuan task. Maybe even too 
much work for a organization of your size. Trolls constantly appear out of 
nowhere, your contributors often talk off topic, and your most loyal members 
are mean to newcomers. Moderation is laborious and thus expensive. But what 
if you would approach governance differently? Rather than policing individual transgressions, Offcourse suggests an holistic approach to govern your community.
