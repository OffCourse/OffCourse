# Value Driven Development

Offcourse develops tailormade software solutions that create value for your organization by valuing your team, your knowledge and your values. 


## Ethical Intelligence

Your organization is driven by values. Making money is important, but certainly not the only thing that matters. But sometimes it is difficult to communicate your values: to customers, partners, but also to your own team. Offcourse transforms your values into measurable, common goals. We put your ethics into practice. 


## Partial Automation

You heard the promise many times: our software will solve all your problems. At Offcourse, we do not believe in generic, all encompassing solutions. Heck, we don't even believe that all of your task should be automated. Many of them require the knowledge and dedication that only you can give. Still, it's a waste to continue to do the task that can by done by a machine manually. Finding the right ways to automate your organization is a process of optimization. Offcourse is your guide through this process.


## Organic Governance

Maintaining a healthy online community is a gargantuan task. Maybe even too much work for a organization of your size. Trolls constantly appear out of nowhere, your contributors often talk off topic, and your most loyal members are mean to newcomers. Moderation is laborious and thus expensive. But what if you would approach governance differently? Rather than policing individual transgressions, Offcourse suggests an holistic approach to govern your community.
