1. Past, Present, and Future

For as long as I can remember, I have loved cutting corners. There is no better
feeling than completing a laborous task with substantially less effort than
others. Some call it *working smarter, not harder*, but this expression has
never really done it for me. Cutting corners is not about working less: it's
about being faster, more creative, more ambitious, and less wasteful.


## Early Life

Looking back, I would probably argue that my love for cutting corners was born
out of plain survival. My motoric skills as a kid were extremely weak. As a
result, writing by hand was very slow and even physically painful for me. I thus
developed the habit to avoid the activity as much as possible. Soon after I
discovered the word 'idem', it became the most frequently used word on my tests.
Why write something twice, if once suffices? 

Not coincidently, I discovered computers and programming around the same time.
Loops enabled me not even having to repeat the act of writing the word 'idem'
anymore. 

```basic
10 print "Yeehaa Was Here!!!!!"
20 goto 10
```

This power to delegate repetive tasks to machines still does not fail to impress
me until this very day. Why don't we use it a lot more?


## High School

Above anything else, however, it was the dire boredom of high school that shaped
this dispositon into a skill. 5.5 (the minimum passing grade in the Dutch
system) was my favorite number. It proved that I put just the right amount of
effort in learning things that were not going to be useful later on. 

In fact, my first year high school teachers were so intimated by my lack of
interests in the curriculum, that they decide to hold me back even though my
grades were sufficient to pass to the next year. Their official explanation: 

> "Jan Hein is too involved with extracurricular activities".

And that was a completely accurate assessment. If only they would have read it
as a reflection of their own performance. 

School failed me. Most teachers were completely unable to motivate me. I was far
from your typical underachiever. I was reading Dostojewsky by 12, president of
both the student parliament and the news paper, and joined a national political
party by 15. But for all the things that I could not see the reason behind,
cutting corners became the only way of life. 

I was willing to make an effort whenever something made sense to me. I blatantly
refused when it didn't. Mandatory attendence and punctuality were two of the
things that I couldn't wrap my head around. When my school tried to introduce a
system of hallway permission slips, I succesfully sabotaged its introduction by
including their template sheet in the school paper. Using technology to make
sure I could slack and sleep in without major consequences, that was true power!


Understanding the corner cutting powers of computers gave me a competitive
advantage. I was digital native in the stone age. A fact that I was all too
eager to point out at the time.

I lost my computer room key privileges after a friend and I alphabetized all the
keys of its IBM Model M's. It took us a whole afternoon, but this was well worth
the effort. An entire day of a first year computer classes was spoiled, because
my peers weren't introduced to the age of QWERTY yet. Was I to blame for their
ignorance? Up until this very day, I maintain that it's debatable.

Even family life, was not exempt from my striving to do more with less. To give
one example: As a Sinterklaas Surprise &mdash; a dutch tradition in which a
Secret Santas makes  mocking gift for eachother &mdash; I once gave my mother a
basket of old dirty laundry. I just wrapped it up a week earlier. Everyone had
been complaining about missing socks and panties for days by then. 

I don't think any other Sinterklaas gift has ever made as much of an impression
in our family.  Everyone still talks about it every year. Would more time and
effort have left impression?


## University

Everything changed when I got to university though. Studying philosophy was my
biggest passion at the time, and slacking was no longer a goal as such.
Instead, my corner cutting activities became aimed at achieving more, not doing
less.

Most of the classes offered did not go deep and fast enough for my taste. So I
approached professors with an alternative proposal. Instead of attending their
class, I would write a paper related to the subject. Saving them of the time and
energy of having to deal with a highly critical in their classroom. Don't
remember any professor that ever refused my offer. Nor did anyone of them notice
that I recycled upto 80% of earlier papers. Templating still rocks in the
1990's!


## Kittler 

...

## Professor Slacker

2006, a university teacher now, I was never inclined to reward other students for
effort either. The grades that I gave were based on the results achieved, not
the time that it took them to get there.  At times, I even thought of grading
systems that penalized superfluous use of time and effort.

This lead, of course, to plenty of complaints from students: 

> It's not fair!
> I worked 40 hours on my paper
> And he did it in only two

Up to the present day, I don't think this argument even justifies an answer. It
does not make any sense to me.

Academia was never the right environment to appreciate my antischolarly mindset
anyways. Even the fact that I had the secretary making photocopies was met with
great suspicion. How stupid of me to think that there were tasks that could be
delegated to people that were hired to do them.

But at the time, academia's disdain of efficiency didn't discourage me yet. It
actually fed directly into my particular brand of OCD. Higher education and
research is filled with opportunities to cut corners, especially since it's
considered a vice to do so. 

Among the experiments that I conducted, these were some of the most
controversial:

+ Splitting a large seminar in two groups. Only offering each group a bi-weekly
session.

+ Peer feedback and grading of exams and papers.

But an assistant professor is illpositioned to change the system, so I
signed up to become the Humanities department's HR Manager as a side-hustle.

My first task was to facilitate the roll-out of the newly introduced mandatory
teaching certificate to the existing teaching staff. Asked how to assess such a
great diversity of experience, my immediate answer went along the following
lines

> Don't. Just give the certificate to them. 
> Some of them have been teaching for over 20 years.
> They have proven their skills. 
> And, if not, they are not gonna improve them anymore.

And while everyone pretended to be appalled by the suggestion, we actually ended
up rolling out something only nominally more substantial. 

Despite these successes, however, I never felt very confident in my role.  The
cocktail of a hyperly optimizing mindset and an environment heavily reluctant to
be subjected to it, had been doomed from the start. In 2012, my inevitable
burn/bore out became a fact.

It could not come at a better time, since it allowed me to reconnect with a lost
love. The early 2010's, marked a true renaissance of computer literacy. And I
passionately wanted to be part of it. Ruby impressed me with it's clear syntax
and it's thinking man's mentality. While the creative coding and data
visualization community showed me that research no longer needed to be textual.

Most importantly, though, The coding community was also the first environment
that shared my cutting corners mentality. When I first discovered that the three
great virtues of a programmer were *laziness, hybris, and impatience* I could
not have been happier. 

So I plotted a career shift. Signed up for a coding bootcamp, and went for San
Francisco in 2013. However, I soon managed to cut some corners there too. After
two weeks of being a student, Dev Bootcamp promoted me to teacher/tutor for the
rest of the summer. Plans changed, instead of shifting career, why not bring
these insights back to revolutionize my old one. Maybe I took 'hybris' a bit too literal?

Back at the University of Amsterdam, I believed that my newfound coding
superpowers would revitalise my academic career. Coding the Humanities was a
secret attempt to mobilize all the former dreamers and slackers into my classroom
into an army of creative coders. It worked, until it didn't.

Offcourse was born out of my conviction that education should all be about
corner cutting. A global community of learners that didn't want to waste their
talent by engaging in month long programs and degrees. Instead, we tried to
break down to its most basic building blocks: simple todo lists of practical
tasks. Teaching them to eliminate the repetitive one function at a time.

Students were amazing. More surprisingly, administration was very supportive
too. Only problem were these same colleagues that complained about the copying.
To them, the idea of automating tasks clashed with their scholastic romanticism.
The mere idea of a computer that could release them of the boring parts and
insult to their very existence.


## Offcourse

Quit my job, took a couple of students with me. We are in Edtech now. But hey,
founding a startup is not difficult enough, so let's make it a value-driven,
opensource, nonprofit foundation too. 

But at least the ethical angle differentiated my activities from all others.
Waag asked me to help with this new coalition of public institution that they
were founding: Public Spaces. Apparently there was a demand for an ethical
internet. Problem, however, no one knew were to find it or how to start it. Was
I willing to help them with that?

So we're doing consultancy now? Shifting my attention to these new projects

Planet B / Bots with An Attitude

But through all of this, there is this lurking feeling that there is still an
amazing company in me somewhere. Something that brings all these things
together. Or better yet, an company that starts to eliminate all these
unnecessay laborous tasks one by one. **Cuthooks**: systematically cutting
corners since 2020.


## Learnings

Turns out that a life of corner cutting does not lead to a shorter journey after
all...

But no regrets! That's the price of learning. Question is, what lessons did I
learn. I'd say the following:

+ People need to be familiarized with the idea that cutting corners is a good
thing. We are told from a very early age that we have to suffer through laborous
tasks to succeed. In fact, our whole education system is build on this idea, It
needs a fair amount of unlearning before we can progress as a species.

+ Only optimize professional practices that are open to the idea of change.
Don't worry about the rest. They will perish soon anyways.

+ Start with low hanging fruit. There are still so many unnecessary, boring
tasks that could be automated that are now done manually, that we may not even
have the desire to automate the high hanging fruit once we get there.

+ Mechanization and automation have only produced more jobs over the last 200
years, and will continue to do so. They mostly took over tasks that were close
to slavery anyways. If anything, robotics and AI will make us more human.

+ Technology is still full of untapped potential. No Google or Facebook is
going to be close to fully utilize it any time soon. Creative tactics will
always win from all-encompassing strategies.

+ The future of AI will be local and contextual. Understanding irony should be
the new Turing Test. As long as there is no general AI that can capture all
winks and jokes  under all circumstances, there will be plenty of ways out of
surveillance capitalism. Lighten up folks!
