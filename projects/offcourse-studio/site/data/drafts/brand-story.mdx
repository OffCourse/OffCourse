1. Past, Present, and Future

For as long as I can remember, I have loved cutting corners. There is no better
feeling than completing a laborous task in substantially less time than others.
*Working Smarter, Not Harder* as some people would call it nowadays. But this
expression has never really done it for me. Cutting corners is not about working
less: it's about being faster, more creative, more innovative, and less
wasteful.

Probably more than anything else, the boredom of high school shaped this innate
dispositon into a skill. The 5.5 (the minimum passing grade in the Dutch system)
was my favorite grade. It showed that I put just the right amount of effort in
learning things that were not going to be useful later on. Soon after I
discovered the word 'idem', it became the most frequently used word on my tests.  

It's around the same time, I first discovered my love for computers and
programming. Loops enabled me not even having to repeat the act of writing
the word 'idem' anymore. 

```basic
10 print "Yeehaa Was Here!!!!!"
20 goto 10
```

This power to delegate repetive tasks to computers still does not fail to
impress me until this very day.

Later in life, a teacher now, I was never prone to reward effort either. The
grades that I gave, were based on the results achieved, not the time that it
took them to get there.  At times, I even tought of grading systems that
penalized superfluous use of time and effort.

This lead, of course, to plenty of complaints from students: 'It's not fair! I
worked 40 hours on my paper, and he did it in only two". Up to the present day,
I don't think this argument even justifies an answer. It does not make any
sense to me.

Academia was never the right environment to appreciate my antischolarly mindset
anyways. Even the fact that I had the secretary making photocopies was met with
great suspicion. How stupid of me to think that they were tasks that could be
outsourced.

But at the time, that didn't discourage me yet. On the contrary, academia's
disdain of efficiency actually fed directly into my particular brand of OCD.
That world is filled with opportunities to cut corners, exactly since it's considered a vice to do so. 

But an assistant professor is not well positioned to change the system, so I
signed up to become the Humanities department's HR Manager as a side-hustle.

My first task was to facilitate the roll-out of the newly introduced mandatory
teaching certificate to the existing teaching staff. Asked how to assess such a
great diversity of experience, my immediate answer was something like this: 

> "Don't. Just give the certificate to them. Some of them have been teaching for
> over 20 years, they have proved their skills. And, if not, they are not gonna
> change it anymore."

And while everyone pretended to be appalled by the suggestion, we ended up
rolling out something only nominally more substantial. 

Despite these successes, however, I never felt very confident in my role.  The
cocktail of a hyperly optimizing mindset and an environment heavily reluctant to
be subjected to it, had been doomed from the start. In 2012, my inevitable
burn/bore out became a fact.

It could not come at a better time, since it allowed me to reconnect with a lost
love. The early 2010's, marked a true renaissance of computer literacy. And I
passionately wanted to be part of it. Ruby impressed me with it's clear syntax
and it's thinking man's mentality. While the creative coding and data
visualization community showed me that research no longer needed to be textual.

Most importantly, though, The coding community was also the first environment
that shared my cutting corners mentality. When I first discovered that the three
great virtues of a programmer were *laziness, hybris, and impatience* I could
not have been happier. 

So I plotted a career shift. Signed up for a coding bootcamp, and went for San
Francisco in 2013. However, I soon managed to cut some corners there too. After
two weeks of being a student, Dev Bootcamp promoted me to teacher/tutor for the
rest of the summer. Plans changed, instead of shifting career, why not bring
these insights back to revolutionize my old one. Maybe I took 'hybris' a bit too literal?

Back at the University of Amsterdam, I believed that my newfound coding
superpowers would revitalise my academic career. Coding the Humanities was a
secret attempt to mobilize all the former dreamers and slackers into my classroom
into an army of creative coders. It worked, until it didn't.

Offcourse was born out of my conviction that education should all be about
corner cutting. A global community of learners that didn't want to waste their
talent by engaging in month long programs and degrees. Instead, we tried to
break down to its most basic building blocks: simple todo lists of practical
tasks. Teaching them to eliminate the repetitive one function at a time.

Students were amazing. More surprisingly, administration was very supportive
too. Only problem were these same colleagues that complained about the copying.
To them, the idea of automating tasks clashed with their scholastic romanticism.
The mere idea of a computer that could release them of the boring parts and
insult to their very existence.

Quit my job, took a couple of students with me. We are in Edtech now. But hey,
founding a startup is not difficult enough, so let's make it a value-driven,
nonprofit foundation too. 

But at least the ethical angle differentiated my activities from all others.
Waag asked me to help with this new coalition of public institution that they
were founding: Public Spaces. Apparently there was a demand for an ethical
internet. Problem, however, no one knew were to find it or how to start it. Was
I willing to help them with that?

So we're doing consultancy now? Shifting my attention to these new projects

Planet B / Bots with An Attitude

But through all of this, there is this lurking feeling that there is still an
amazing company in me somewhere. Something that brings all these things
together. Or better yet, an company that starts to eliminate all these
unnecessay laborous tasks one by one. **Cuthooks**: systematically cutting
corners since 2020.

Turns out that corner cutting does not lead to a shorter journey after all...

But no regrets! That's the price of learning. Question is, what lessons did I
learn. I'd say the following:

+ People need to be familiarized with the idea that cutting corners is a good
thing. We are told from a very early age that we have to suffer through laborous
tasks to succeed. In fact, our whole education system is build on this idea, It
needs a fair amount of unlearning before we can progress as a species.

+ Only optimize professional practices that are open to the idea of change.
Don't worry about the rest. They will perish soon anyways.

+ Start with lowhanging fruit. There are still so many unnecessary, boring
tasks that could be automated that are now done manually, that we may not even
have the desire to automate the highhanging fruit once we get there.

+ Mechanization and automation have only produced more jobs over the last 200
years, and will continue to do so. They mostly took over tasks that were close
to slavery anyways. If anything, robotics and AI will make us more human.

+ Technology is still full of untapped potential. No Google or Facebook is
going to be close to fully utilize it any time soon. Creative tactics will
always win from all-encompassing strategies.

+ The future of AI will be local and contextual. Understanding irony should be
the new Turing Test. As long as there is no general AI that can capture all
winks and jokes  under all circumstances, there will be plenty of ways out of
surveillance capitalism. Lighten up folks!

Work should be fun, creative, and productive. There is absolutely no honor in
performing labourous task that could be automated.
