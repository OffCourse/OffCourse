excerpt: |
  Artificial Intelligence is a harmless misnomer at best. At its worst, it
  projects a damaging future of technology and the role it can play in society.
  In this post, I explain how the concept of creativity should accompany that of
  intelligence, to course correct the future of technology.

While the mechanical phonograph cylinder was invented in 1877, it took almost an
entire century before Edison's device was released from [His Master's
Voice](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/04/28/his-masters-voice-the-origins-of-the-famous-jack-russell-terrier-nipper-the-canine-advertising-icon-for-many-gramophone-companies/).
Sound Engineers and musicians were so endeared with the [pipe
dream](https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1947.593) of [High Fidelity](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/high-fidelity-high-definition1.htm), that they
completely overlooked the creative possibilities that the grammophone could also
offer. 

Once Pandorra was out off the box &mdash; and no, it weren't [John, 
Paul, George & Ringo](https://www.unifiedmanufacturing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1.jpg) that released her &mdash; music would never be the same
again. Sound engineers projected the recording arts beyond the spatial and
temporal boundaries of reality. Or, to put it in the lingo of Sun Ra,
Music was no longer earth-bound; space was now the place.

I believe that the discourse of so-called Artificial Intelligence is also in
desperate need to be released of the shackles of fidelity. Rather than repeat
and hollow out the forms that people have developed, deep learning could be used
to explore new and better ways to be intelligent. The only thing it needs now is
our permission to start realizing ts full potential.

Supervised learning is the most used branch of Artificial Intelligence. The
supervision in its name, designates the practices of developing a human baseline. This baseline is formalized in the interplay
between the training data and loss function. For those not familiar with this
process and these terms, I'll briefly explain it.

At its inception model, an artificial intelligence model knows nothing about
the domain that it's being applied to. To improve itself, it has to be taught
what's right and wrong, or at least what's better and worse. And who better to
teach her than it's creator?

Like every inventor, the programmer is too eager to shape its creation into
its own image. But what if we were to take the human baseline out of the loop?
This process is called: *unsupervised learning*.

Apart from creative, I believe that this new form of intelligence should also be
ethical, but that topic deserves a post of its own.
