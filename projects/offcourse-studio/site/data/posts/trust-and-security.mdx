  On the internet, lacunas of trust are mostly countered with tightening
  security measures. This move hardly ever results in the intended result,
  but almost always weakens the trust relations between digital citizens.
  With Public Badges, we enable organizations and initiatives to communicate 
  why they are thrustworthy to their users.

Finding examples of failed trust relations has never been difficult, but today
it's actually quite a challenge to miss them. Governments don't trust their
citizens to stay inside, and citizens don't believe that their governments are
acting in their best interest. Strangers are vessels for deadly viruses, and
viruses are dangerous weapons developed by foreign goverments. In fact,
contemporary global politics closely resembles a [Mexican
Standoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_standoff).

Meanwhile on the internet, things are not looking much brighter.  Consumers are
constantly forced to accept a Faustian tradeoff: either hand over your personal
data or give up your social life. Trusting sources of information has become
next to impossible. Knowledge has become a entertaining conversation starter, but does not hold any weight as such. One man's facts is another's fake news. 

Amidst all these suspicious minds, however, I am optimistic that we can rebuild
trust relations in the public realm: both online and offline. Public Badges are
our modest attempt to provide building blocks that enable organizations and
initiatives to communicate their values with their users. To build trust
relations build on evidence, not just annecdotes.


## Trust and Security

As my teacher Friedrich Kittler posed, Code was originally developed to
establish secure communication against a backdrop of suspicion. Its invention
dates back to the Roman Empire. Foot soldiers were ordered to carry encrypted
messages &mdash that they could not decypher themselves &mdash to other higher
officers that were also entrusted with the key. They thereby actively performed
the paradox that holds the internet hostage today: a secure network of
communication comes at the expense of trust.

Looking back at the history of the internet, it is easy to see that we invested
a lot in making our technology secure, but not nearly as much in making it
trustworthy. Security measures alone, however, never made our digital spaces any
safer. In fact, most attempts to create safe digital public spaces based
on security alone failed or even backfired. Whereas the solution was often found
by looking in exactly the opposite direction: by building networks of trust.

In order to illustrate this, I'll walk you through a very similar example: spam
filtering. Up until the mid 1990's, little to nothing was done to prevent the
unwanted solliciting on the internet. However, the rising importance of digital
communication combined with the overwhelming increase of unwanted emails created
a demand for spam filters. The first attempts all revolved around blocking
suspicious domain and filtering for unwanted emails. These measure, however,
weren't very effective. Spammers soon discovered techniques like domain and
identity spoofing that made it increasingly to distinguish between email and
space. 

The big breakthrough came during the mid 2000's when ISP's shifted to so-called
reputation lists, something that was complemented with engagement metrics over
the last decade. Instead of sharing the blacklist, they started sharing their
whitelist. Turns out, it's much more effective to build networks of trusted
partners than to police offenders [*The history of anti-virus software by the
way is remarkably similar].


## Public Badges

In order to make the internet more safe, we have to invest in building networks
of trust. In order to achieve this, technology alone can never be the answer.
But it can be part of it, and it needs to be. Because even more dangerous than
letting trust be a purely algorithmic consideration, is leaving it entirely
annecdotal. "I know him, [he's a good
guy](https://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/989101/10-ways-to-tell-if-he-is-a-good-guy/)",
is a statement that was invalidated for once and for all by: ["Don't be
evil."](https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393)

The safety of our [Public Spaces](https://publicspaces.net) needs to be evidence
based. With Public Badges, we enable organizations to collect and communicate
the evidence around the values that they consider valuable. In future posts,
I'll write more about the exact mechanisms that we are developing to facilitate
these processes. For now, however, I want to conclude by saying this:
sustainable safety cannot be build upon security. Let's invest in trust instead.
