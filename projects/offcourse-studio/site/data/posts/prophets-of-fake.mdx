excerpt: | 
  Fake news is often treated as a property of information. However on a content
  level facts and lies are now mostly impossible to distinguish. In this post, I
  argue that we should bypass this problem by focusing on the agent rather than
  on the news.

Through the miracles of the [early
internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LzyRcLJdlg), I discovered the [Weekly
World News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_World_News) in high school.
Journalism never was the same to me again. Why
[read](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49985/where-are-they-now-8-things-terrified-us-90s)
about the horrors of acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer, when there was
a newspaper that covered sightings of Marilyn Monroe and [Bat
Boy](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gdkwv/an-interview-with-the-creator-of-bat-boy-987)
instead?

Obviously, my own journalistic endeavors had to follow suit. Being the 
editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, I started to take inspiration from my
newly discovered favorite news source by blurring the lines between fact,
rumors, and fiction. My piece de resistance: a [Dear
Mary](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/dear-mary-your-problems-solved) item
that featured letters from the teaching staff. 

Our Mary &mdash; named Hans &mdash; gave the English teacher some much needed
tough love about his financial problems, but was also warm and understanding
when the Gym teacher opened up about his sexually frustrations. [Generoso Pope
Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generoso_Pope_Jr.)
would have been proud. 

Alas, the dean was of a different opinion. After two marvelous issues, I was
removed from my post. Although I was clearly not amused by his actions at the
time, in retrospect, I would argue that the dean handled the problem of fake
news in an exemplary manner. The key to his success: his actions were not
focused on the news itself, but on the agent that spread it.
