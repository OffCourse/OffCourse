  Fake news is often treated as a property of information. However on a content
  level facts and lies are mostly impossible to distinguish. In this post, I
  suggest that we focus on the agent instead by gamifying their reputation.

Through the miracles of the [early
internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LzyRcLJdlg), I discovered the [Weekly
World News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_World_News) in high school.
Journalism never was the same to me again. Why
[read](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49985/where-are-they-now-8-things-terrified-us-90s)
about the horrors of acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer, when there was
a newspaper that covered sightings of Marilyn Monroe and [Bat
Boy](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gdkwv/an-interview-with-the-creator-of-bat-boy-987)
instead?

Obviously, my own journalistic endeavors had to follow suit. Being the 
editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, I started to take inspiration from my
newly discovered favorite news source by blurring the lines between fact,
rumors, and fiction. My piece de resistance: a [Dear
Mary](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/dear-mary-your-problems-solved) item
that featured letters from the teaching staff. 

Our Mary &mdash; named Hans &mdash; gave the English teacher some much needed
tough love about his financial problems, but was also warm and understanding when
the Gym teacher opened up about his sexually frustrations. Generoso Pope Jr.
would have been proud. Alas, the dean was of a different opinion. After
two marvelous issues, I was removed from my post. 

Although I was clearly not amused by his actions at the time, in retrospect, I
would argue that the dean handled the problem of fake news in an exemplary
manner. The key to his success: his actions were not focused on the news itself,
but on the agent that disseminated it.

1. Associate fake news to an agent

2. Adjust the reputation score of the corresponding agent negatively

3. Remove the agent from discourse when its reputation drops below a treshhold

In fact, I believe that we should automate these steps and use them to
improve our online conversations.
