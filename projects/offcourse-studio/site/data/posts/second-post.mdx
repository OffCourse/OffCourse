excerpt: Rationale Behind Bots with an Attitude
---
Future oriented projects like PlanetB and the AI Culture Lab demand a 
different kind of collaboration tools.
In Bots With an Attitude, I am exploring the following questions: 

- What if a chat environment (like slack, rocketchat, etc.) does not 
 differentiate between human and bot users? 
- What if we consider bots as equal members of a creative community?
- What if we treat useless, trolling human members of a community in the same 
  way that we would treat an annoying bot?

Concretely, this premise translates to the following two requirements for 
this project.

- Developing bots that can provide value to the community that they are a 
  part of
- Developing a system of organic and fair system governance that translates 
  the intrinsic values of a community to measurable and (more importantly) 
  actionable rules and principles

In order to accomplish this, I am combining state of the art AI technologies 
like local AI (tensorflow.js) with its nearly forgotten predecessors such 
as Cellular Automata and rule-based systems. I believe a combination of these 
approaches is needed to solve aforementioned challenges. 

In my talk, I will present the current state of the project. I will discuss 
the design prototypes for the bots and the choices and compromises that I 
have made so far. I will demonstrate the 'protobot' that was produced in 
collaboration with a group of interns from HvA's AI minor. I talk about what 
needs to be done in the following months and years. But most importantly, I 
want to pick your brains and bring these findings back to the project.
