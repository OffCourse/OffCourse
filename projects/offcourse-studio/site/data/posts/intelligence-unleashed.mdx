  Artificial Intelligence is a harmless misnomer at best. At its worst, it
  projects a damaging future of technology and the role it can play in society.
  In this post, I explain how the concept of creativity should accompany that of
  intelligence, to course correct the future of technology.

While the mechanical phonograph cylinder was invented in 1877, it took almost an
entire century before Edison's device was released from [His Master's
Voice](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/04/28/his-masters-voice-the-origins-of-the-famous-jack-russell-terrier-nipper-the-canine-advertising-icon-for-many-gramophone-companies/).
Sound Engineers and musicians were so endeared with the [pipe
dream](https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1947.593) of [High Fidelity](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/high-fidelity-high-definition1.htm), that they
completely overlooked the creative possibilities that the grammophone could also
offer. 

Once Pandorra was out off the box &mdash; and no, it weren't [John, 
Paul, George & Ringo](https://www.unifiedmanufacturing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1.jpg) that released her &mdash; music would never be the same
again. Sound engineers projected the recording arts beyond the spatial and
temporal boundaries of reality. Or, to put it in the lingo of Sun Ra,
Music was no longer earth-bound; space was now the place.

I believe that the
[discourse](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generating-word-cloud-python/) of
so-called Artificial Intelligence is also in desperate need to be released of
the shackles of fidelity. Technically, the field has been there for quite a
while. Unsupervised Machine Learning is the branch of machine learning that does
not need a human baseline to improve its findings, but rather finds patterns that
are beyond the scope of human cognition and categorization. 

Stubborn creatures as they are, however, people are often still reluctant to
accept that their intelligence is surpassed by their own creation. Instead, they
rather hold on to their primitve and biased observations. This post argues that
this should change.

Supervised learning is the most commonly used branch of machine learning.  The
supervision in its name, designates the practices of developing a human
baseline. This baseline is operationalized in the
[feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_feedback) loop between the
training data and loss function. For those not familiar with this process and
these terms, I'll briefly explain it.

Like most unborns, a machine learning model knows nothing about the world at
its inception. To improve, it needs to be taught what's right and wrong, or at
least what's better and worse. And who better to teach her than it's creator?
Right? 

In order to train a model, programmers feed a model a set of problems with known
answers (labels). These anwers, however, are hidden to the model. At the end of
each learning cycle (epoch) the anwers that the algorithm comes up with are
compared to the actual answers, and the difference in accuracy (or a similar
metric) is measured.

[SOME MORE EXPLANATION ABOUT BASELINE]

Like every inventor, the programmer is eager to shape its creation into its own
image. But what if we were to take the human baseline out of the loop?  This
process is called: [unsupervised learning]().


## Low-Fidelity

Unsupervised learning is
[amoral](https://librivox.org/search?title=Beyond+Good+and+Evil&author=Nietzsche&reader=&keywords=&genre_id=0&status=all&project_type=either&recorded_language=&sort_order=catalog_date&search_page=1&search_form=advanced);
there is no right and wrong. In fact, there is not even a clearly defined set of
problems or questions. Instead there are just data points. These data points are
converted to vectors, which for the sake of simplicity, are best thought of as
coordinates. An algorithm can then measure the distance between these
coordinates and group them in clusters on the basis of their proximity to each
other.

The classic use-case for this form of unsupervised learning is in marketing.
Where marketeers used to work with [user personae](), imaginary categories of
how their different customers look like and behave. 

Machine learning reversed the process and discovered where clusters of customers
are present in the data. While this was bad news for the story tellers,
this cluster based targeting turned out to be much more effective&hellip;
although occasional happy accidents do occur, of course.

In marketing, the benefits of unsupervised learnings are easy to sell. Simply
because the human baseline is of less importance than another measurable goal:
the bottom line. In other domains, we often are less willing to accept that
computers can come up with better categorizations than us. Just imagine the following conclusions:

+ The music of Johan Sebastian Bach has more similarities to that of Justin
Bieber than to that of [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVikZ8Oe_XA)

+ The most effective way to solve the climate crisis is the global
redistribution of wealth

+ The sun revolves around the earth after all

These findings are completely made up, but are here to illustrate the
following point. Are we willing to accept the superiority of an algorithm when
its conclusions are counter to our own? Or in other words, are we capable of
dropping the human baseline? Lower our own voice to make room for better ones?

We should!

Machine Learning does not need to repeat and hollow out human intelligence. It
should be used to explore new and better ways to be intelligent. The only thing
it needs to unleash its full potential is our permission to drop the base...
line.
