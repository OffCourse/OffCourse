title: Partial Automation

excerpt: |
  People often argue that their specific workload cannot be automated
  because it either requires highly specialized knowledge or year of
  experience. In this post, I go through two examples 
  - ethical values and design system - to show that this argument presupposes 
  a misguided all or nothing perspective on automation. I believe that 
  this perspective is crippling a profession's progress. 
  Partial automation, on the other hand, acknowledges the fact that there 
  are things that cannot be automated, by exactly automating as much as 
  possible. Thereby freeing up resources to focus on the critical parts
  of your workload.
