  In 2013, way before corona and social distancing, Marijn Koolen and I proposed
  that the University of Amsterdam what take a large part of their teaching
  online. Not as a budget cut, but as an opportunity to increase the quality of
  education.

In 2013, two some what naieve humanities scholars that liked computers and
coding &mdash; wrote a letter to their dean. In this letter, Marijn Koolen and I
argued that the faculty should start taking online learning seriously: not as a
threat, not as a way to safe money, but as an opportunity to increase the
quality of higher education and research.

Part of our enthousiasm back in 2013, was motivated by the enormous innovations
that we were witnessing in coding education. There where plenty of initiatives
in that space: Codecademy, Gitbook, Peepcode. They were all difficult, but great
in their own right. 

To me, however, there was one platform that raised above all the others: [Code
School](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUFbBYzSUafxMpUbTmroGhg). This now [defunct](https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/26/online-learning-service-pluralsight-acquires-code-school-for-36-million/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKl1FdHKIHpcP0q6mq-o9wLOibALGWj_ggQv8xHqEgvJPip7Sz4Ks27-LI3MxGdo55-Lp8l9WkpuOgkjHawCRFAqu3lupNqIZa8BeiqIGT6mYi403dQ5obyfXPlDdM9RQLJECFx0F-C8Apc-6_riKxRY-dEz8jLQcmrRu76nh52a) learning platform combined short videos with
in-browser coding assignments thatre we checked automatically. The fact that all
of its courses had creative themes such as the zombie apocalypse ([Rails for
Zombies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4Zg6cLPO4Q)) or Monty Python ([Flying
through Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-INpnJROvgM)), for example
&mdash;,  Code School into [nerd
nirvana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FklUAoZ6KxY).

So we wrote a letter. Got the money to do a pilot. More people joined and left.
We did a bootcamp with a group of amazing students. Took them to
[Chicago](https://ti.to/bocoup/roost-chicago-2014/en) and
[London](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/10/28/mozilla-hosts-seventh-annual-mozfest-in-london-this-weekend/mozfest-2014/).
Coding the Humanities became a Unacademic. We hired external contractors to
build a platform with us. But somehow the project never came from the ground.

After a while, Marijn and I both left the university. Marijn to go back to his
real love: data science. Me, pursuing the impossible dream. Turning our project
into a &mdash; bear with me &mdash; non-profit, open source, education platform
called [Offcourse](https://offcourse.io).

A few days ago, I found back the proposal that Marijn and I wrote in 2013. 

What struck me was the following. 

In 2020, we are still talking about online education as if it is second best&hellip;

Why?


## 2013 Redux

> That I did not want to be   
> But I'm new here   
> Will you show me around?

So where is this elusive letter, you may ask.

*Can I read it?*

*Maybe*

*Only if you promise not to laugh*

In 2020, I'm embarassed by it. The broad generalisations, vagueness of our
alternative, our obsession with MOOCs. It all seem some what silly to me
now. 

In 2020, I don't even understand half of the doument myself anymore. 

And that may be a lesson in itself.


## The Original Letter

> The hand that wrote this letter sweeps the pillow clean  
> So rest your head and read a treasured dream  
>
> &mdash; David Bowie

Students and scholars in the humanities generally rely on prefabricated tools to guide and instruct their learning and research. They are reluctant to engage with computers and technology through coding. This remains a major distinction between the humanities and the sciences. The sciences design, create and maintain their own relevant digital research enviornments and tools, while the humanities make do with prefabricated, and often inappropriate, tools. 

At the moment, there are no broadly available academic programming courses aimed at humanities scholars. For various reasons, however, coding skills are needed now more than ever, and even more so in the future: 

1. Knowledge of programming helps students and researchers to understan the various technologically mediated objects that they are studying. 

2. Developing custom tools, rather than using ready-made ones, can improve the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and quality) of its output.

3. There is an ever-growing demand in the public and private sector for academics who can read and write code.


## Online First

### MOOCs

Online academic education is currently mainly offered in the form of Massive Open Online Courses. 
There is a reasonable fear, however, that the lack of individual feedback and direct interaction in those MOOC will lead to a decay of quality of education and scholarship.

### How we avoid MOOC problems 

We believe, that a different, more creative use of online teaching and learning environments can actually help us educate both larger numbers of students as well as give more attention to the individual student. We call this approach "online first". It combines an interactive, dynamic teaching and learning environment with large Q&A sessions and smaller peer-feedback groups.

### What Online First Courses need 

Online First Courses contain the following elements:

+ Online reading material and exercises with behaviour-driven feedback

+ Collaborative assignments (working out online exercises together)

+ Peer-feedback in small groups, via online platform and offline meetings (Not Just Online)

+ Large Q&A sessions where students get direct feedback from teachers (requires calendar-based schedules, although course could still be open outside the schedule for DIY learning)

+ Detailed individual feedback (from teachers? from online learning environment?)

+ Detailed metrics of the course to monitor progress of individual students and groups of students (to indicate where they encounter problems).

### What most MOOCs have 

MOOCs open up access to education for large numbers of students via the Web, while keeping the amount of work for the teacher manageable. MOOCs across the world often contain the following aspects:

+ Online enrolment, allowing students across the world to participate

+ Students engage with course material on an interactive, collaborative online platform.

+ Online interaction with material and other students allows tracking of progress and problems

### What most MOOCs don't have

Some important aspects for Online First Courses that most MOOCs lack are:

+ Broadcast MOOCs rely on automated feedback but lack peer-feedback and teacher feedback

+ Connectivist MOOCs rely on peer-feedback but lack teacher feedback

+ Detailed personalised feedback (often limited to specific feedback on most common mistakes)

### Problems with most MOOCs 

Many MOOCs suffer from the following problems:

+ Only a small fraction of enrolled students are active

+ MOOCs are often in an uninspiring format of short video lectures and online quizzes

+ Lack of serious pedagogy

## Group Projects

Programming offers opportunities for new kinds of collaborative work. Larger research projects no longer need to be divided into several topics or objects, but people can divide labor through different tasks and skill sets, using tools developed by humanities scholars for humanities scholarship. The various research techniques that can be explored programmatically include: 

+ parsing 

+ visualization 

+ mapping 

+ interfacing

+ searching

+ computation 

+ translation

+ linking 

This kind of large scale collaborative projects will make the humanities more attractive for external funding.


## Employability

The kind of humanities teaching that we propose will give the UvA Humanities Faculty a unique profile, which will not only lead to innovative forms of humanities research but also make our students more employable. It will also provide a test-bed for innovative new forms of on-line learning developed specifically for the needs of humanities teaching and learning. The proposed course, with its corresponding learning and teaching environment, is the first step in achieving this vision. 

*p.s. the David Bowie quote was not included in the original letter&hellip;
unfortunately.*
