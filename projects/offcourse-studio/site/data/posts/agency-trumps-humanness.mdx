excerpt: | 
  Last year, I was asked to develop a vision for online collaboration for the
  Planet B project. The challenge: building a community of people that may never
  be in the same place at the same time. The solution: a mob of bots. Bots with
  an attitude.

The premise of [Planet B](https://planet-b.eu/) is deceptively simple: What
would happens if we were to discover another habitable planet. How would we
approach such a new beginning? What habits, ideas,and people do we leave behind
on the old planet?  What team of experts will we send out on a first expedition?
What instruments will these pioneers need? The idea may be simple, but the
questions and opportunities are literally endless.

When [Chris Julien](https://twitter.com/chrisjulien) told me about his plans for
an exploratory mission to Planet B, I was immediately sold. His team would
consist of so-called 'artistic researchers'. People who are operating on the
verge of art and science. This made sense to me, designing a new world is not
only a matter of science, it is a creative projection on an unknown canvas.
Something that requires both scientific knowledge and esthetical sensibilities.

Given the fact that I am neither a scientist nor an artist, my assigned role,
would not involve any fieldwork. Instead, I was asked to fulfill a supporting
task. As a [basecamp
manager](http://www.theyet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Roles-and-Responsibilities.pdf),
I would be responsible for logistics and communication. Making sure that the
expedition team has every that they need to make their mission into a success.
But how to equip a team for a expedition into the complete unknown?

To complicate matters even further, the exact composition of the team itself was
not known either. But it was clear from the beginning that the team would be
physically and temporarily dispersed. Remote collaboration would have to be the
rule, not the exception.  But how to build a community when the people involved
may never be in the same place at the same time? 

Our solution: complement the human members of our team with a mob of bots.


## Bots With An Attitude

Bots With An Attitudes is an attempt to shift the balance in remote
collaboration from humanness to agency. Does it really matter if a coworker is
an actual person when its contributions are valuable? And, pushing this one step
further, does it matter that someone is an actual person when his or her
contributions are endagering the team and the expedition?

The counterfactual premise of Planet B offers an excellent playground to explore
these questions in a safe space. We are still at the beginning of this journey,
but ....

In a next post about this project, I'll explain the most unexpected problem 
that I encountered to achieve this. Bot frameworks only allow bots to talk to
people, not to each other.
