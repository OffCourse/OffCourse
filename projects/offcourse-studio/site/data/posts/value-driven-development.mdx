A lot of has been written recently about the lack of ethics in the tech
industry. ... ... ... 

While this critique probably applies to the upper echelons of the big
coorporations, I believe it to be an unfair assessment of the field as a whole.
While ethics is not always at the forefront of every developer's mind, it is a
mistake to conclude that her work is thus immoral. Heck, I would not even call
it amoral. 

A lot of software development &mdash; especially Open Source Software (OSS)
&mdash; is driven by values. From the Google Developer that aims to make the web
more accesible and the Facebook Developer trying to ..., to the. Most software
developers actually want to make the world a better place, even if &mdash; or
especially when &mdash; their ethics don't alway align with their company's. The
real problem, however, is that these values are hardly ever made explicit. 

In this article, I explain how Public Badges build on existing paradigms of Test
Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to help engineers
render the implicit values that drive their work explicit. By making values,
measurable, testable, and communicable, Public Badges enable customers,
partners, and end users to chose software solutions that aligns with their own
values. Public Badges don't prescribe a certain set of morals, but facilitate
the discussion about values.

Ruby was the first programming language that I truly loved. Its emphasis on
readability and conceptual clarity is unrivaled. But a large part of Ruby's
appeal came from its ecosystem, and its community's dedication to test driven
development.
