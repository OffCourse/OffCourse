There has been no shortage lately of stories about the tech industry's
questionable ethics. We all read the stories. A smart security camera company
is working with law enforcement to create an unofficial surveillance network.
Tech executives photoshopfemale executives into their snapshots of a field
trip before sharing them on instagram. The algorithm of a new credit card
determines credit limits on the basis of gender. And the list goes on and on.

Still, while the critique of immorality may apply to the upper echelons of the
big coorporations, I believe it to be an unfair assessment of the field as a
whole. While ethics is not always at the forefront of every developer's mind, it
is a mistake to conclude that her work is thus immoral. In fact, I would not
even call it amoral. 

A lot of software development &mdash; especially Open Source Software (OSS)
&mdash; is driven by values. From the Google Developer that aims to make the web
more accesible, the Facebook Developer that open sources her internal tools, to
the commited idealist developing a fair OS. 

Most software developers actually want to make the world a better place, even if
&mdash; or especially when &mdash; their ethics don't alway align with their
company's. The problem, however, is that these values are not always clear and
visible from the outside.

In this article, I explain how Public Badges build on existing paradigms of Test
Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to help engineers
render the implicit values that drive their work explicit. By making values,
measurable, testable, and communicable, Public Badges enable customers,
partners, and end users to chose software solutions that aligns with their own
values. Public Badges don't prescribe a certain set of morals, but facilitate
the discussion about values.


## Test Driven Development

Ruby was the first programming language that I truly loved. Its emphasis on
readability and conceptual clarity is unrivaled. But a large part of Ruby's
appeal came from its ecosystem, and its community's dedication to testing.

It was almost impossible to learn Ruby without learning how to write unit tests.


Test Driven Development (TDD), however, is more than just the developers
discipline to write unit test. The real innovation of the methodology consists
in the fact that the tests are not written after that you have written the code,
but before. This so-called *test first* approach radically changes the practice
of software development. Before the developer actually writes code, he makes a
promise of what the code should do after it is finished. This gesture as such
could already be considered ethical.
