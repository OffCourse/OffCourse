# Zero Badge

The Zero Badge is a way for organizations that are part of the Public
Spaces coalition to show their affiliation on their website. It provides
visible evidence to the user that the organization has the intention to
implement the Public Spaces values in their online presence.

partners of Public Spaces to apply for the Zero Badge.
