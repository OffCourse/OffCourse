# Zero Badge

The Zero Badge is a way for organizations that are part of the Public
Spaces coalition to show their affiliation on their website. It provides
visible evidence to the user that the organization has the intention to
implement the Public Spaces values in their online presence.

## Get Involved


### 1. Make sure that your organization meets the criteria for Zero Badge

During this phase of development, it is only possible for the founding
partners of Public Spaces to apply for the Zero Badge.

In a later phase, we will open this project up to other organizations.

If you're organization is interested in joining the Public Spaces coalition,
please contact us: [contact@public-spaces.org](contact@public-spaces.org).


### 2. Embed the Public Spaces Badge Container into your webpage

In order to acquire the zero badge, you have to include the Public Spaces
Badge Container webcomponent on your organization's website.

You can download it from npm:


```bash
npm install @public-badges/container
yarn add @public-badges/container
```

```js
import PublicBadgesContainer from "@public-badges/container"
```

or host it directly:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@public-badges/container@1.0.0/umd/container.production.min.js" async></script>
```

The Container is a [webcomponent](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction)
that you can use directly in your html.

```html
<PublicSpacesBadgesContainer />
```

Documentation for the use of webcomponents in your frontend framework of choice,
can be found here: [https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview).


[todo]: Decide on the name. 'Public Badges Container' is not exactly
catchy...

After you embedded the badge in your webpage, you are ready to apply for

After you submitted your request, we will check if your organization meets the
requirements for the zero badge. The two main criteria are:

- Your organization is a member of the public spaces coalition.
- Your organization has included the Public Spaces Badge Container on their
website.

The exact scenarios that the we test, can be found here: [Zero Badge Feature](/src-feature)

As soon as your organization is verified and the badge is issued, it will appear in automatically your badge
container. You can also download the [open badge artifact]() manually through
the link provided.
