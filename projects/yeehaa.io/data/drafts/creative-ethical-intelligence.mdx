excerpt: |
  Artificial Intelligence is a harmless misnomer at best. At its worst, it 
  projects a damaging future of technology and the role it can play
  in society. In this post, I explain how the concepts of creativity and ethics 
  should accompany that of intelligence, to course correct the future of
  technology.

While the mechanical phonograph cylinder was invented in 1877, it took almost an
entire century before Edison's device was released from  "His Master's Voice". 
Sound Engineers and musicians were so endeared with the pipe dream of High Fidelity, 
that they completely overlooked the creative possibilities that the grammophone 
had also opened. Once Pandorra's Box was opened &mdash; and no, it weren't John, 
Paul, George, and Ringo that opened it &mdash; music would never be the same again.

I argue that the discourse of so-called Artificial Intelligence is also in desperate need 
to be released of the shackles of fidelity. Machine Learning should be used to invent new 
and better ways to be intelligent, rather than repeat and hollow out those forms
that humans have developed. And the good news is, we already have the technology
to do so.


## Human intelligence is neither a desirable goal nor a functioning baseline

The concept of Artificial Intelligence cripples the development of Machine
Learning in a similar way. By falsly juxtaposing the natural and the artificial,
humanity remains the alpha and omega of intelligence. More problematically,
though, is that the term implicitly also distinguish between real and fake.
Articial Intelligence is not only a fabricated agent, but also a inferior one.
The Articial Agent is a [sciolist](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sciolist):

## Machine Learning offers an opportunity to redefine intelligence


The Turing test has often be criticized for testing desired responses rather
than testing intelligence. But what if we turn this critique around? What if
it's not the process that fails, but it's the criteria. I'd Turing's

The concept of Artificial Intelligence cripples the development of machine

humanity remains the alpha and omega of intelligence. Computer
induced intelligence is not only a fabricated agent, but also a

## Turing Test Redux

So how could the criteria for such a test look like?

+ The ability to come up with new information

+ The ability to find *more*, relevant information

+ The ability to find *more relevant* information

+ The ability to aggregate and condense information

+ The ability to combine existing information in such a matter that it
provides opens new insights

+ The ability to present information in such a matter that it
provides opens new insights

Apart from ethical, I believe that this new form of intelligence should also be
ethical, but that topic deserves a post of its own.

## Turing Test Redux

The ultimate form of the human baseline is, of course, the infamous Turing
test. A computer is considered to be intelligent if it manages to accurately
mimic human responses under specific set of given conditions.

The Turing test has been criticized numerous times. Most frequently, however,
because it was thought to provide insufficient proof of a computer's mastery of
human intelligence.

So how could the criteria for such a test look like?

+ The ability to find *more*, relevant information

provides opens new insights

+ The ability to present information in such a matter that it

Of course, the philosophers amongst my friends would argue that Kant already
proved this test to be impossible. To them, I simply want to reply. Kant also
believed that Hoompah was the best music thinkable. Meaning that the current
state of reality is by definition limited and therefore not a good horizon for
next steps.
