# Founder Story

For as long as I can remember, I have loved cutting corners. Nothing beats the
feeling of achieving something substiantal while putting in substantially less
effort than others. Some use the expression 'working smarter, not harder' to
describe this process, but this phrase never really cut it for me. Cutting
corners is not about working less: it's about achieving results faster, more
creative, more ambitious, and less wasteful.


## Survival of the Clumsiest

In hindsight, I would probably argue that my love for cutting corners was born
out of plain survival. As a kid, my development was already marked by severe
contradictions. While I could already read and write before starting primary
school, my motoric skills were equally exceptionally weak. 

In practice, this meant that I could not manage to hold a pen in the proper way.
This made writing by hand slow and even physically painful for me. As a coping
strategy, I quickly developed the habit to minimize the activity as much as
possible and, if possible, avoid the activity altogether.

Many a teacher felt that it was her calling to help me overcome this handicap.
Every tool at their disposal, was used to introduce me to the wonders of the
pen: special caps, rewarding stickers, public jest and ridicule. 

Nothing worked. I remained true to myself. I had already developed a way to
write.  Why waste precious time and effort on learning another one?


## The Template of Doom

Soon after I discovered the word 'idem', it became the most frequently used word
on my tests. Why write something twice, if once suffices? Idem felt like a magic
word. Better yet, it felt as a command that held special powers.

Not coincidently, I discovered computers and programming around the same time.
Loops released me from even having to repeat the act of writing the word 'idem':

```basic
10 print "Yeehaa Was Here!!!!!"
20 goto 10
```

This discovery made me question everything I learned in school thus far. Why
perform repetive tasks when machines can do them for us?  

The power to delegate boring, repetive tasks to machines manages to impress me
until this very day.  Why don't we use it a lot more?


## Just Passing By

Above anything else,it was the dire boredom of high school that shaped my
dispositon to cut corners into a skill. 5.5 &mdash; the minimum passing grade in
the Dutch education system &mdash; was my favorite number. It proved that I put
just the right amount of effort in learning things that were not going to be
useful later on. 

In fact, my first year' high school teachers were so troubled by my lack of
interests in the official curriculum that they decided to hold me back even
though my grades were sufficient to pass to the next year. Their official
explanation said the following:

> Jan Hein shows little to no interest in his school work.   
> We find him too involved in extracurricular activities.

And that was a completely accurate assessment. 

If only they had understood it as a reflection of their own performance. 


## Motivation Slips

School failed me. Most teachers were completely unable to motivate me. 

Matters were further complicated, however, by the fact that I was far from your
typical underachiever. I was reading Dostojewsky by 12, president of both the
student parliament and the news paper, and joined a national political party by
15. But for all the things that I could not see the reason behind, cutting
corners became the only way of life. 

I was more than willing to make an effort whenever something made sense to me,
but blatantly refused to do them when it didn't. Mandatory attendence and
punctuality were two of the things that I couldn't wrap my head around. 

When my school tried to introduce a system of hallway permission slips, I
succesfully sabotaged its introduction by printing their template sheet in the
school paper. 

Best thing was, that I did so with explicit permission from the dean. He even
provided me with the official template. How did manage to convince him? Simple.
I told him that the article that I wrote about the new system would benefit from
a visual illustration... 

... and I had promised to invalidate the template by putting another magic word
on it. 

```
SPECIMEN
```

Which I obediently did! This amazing command that renders real things fake was
clearly included on ONE out of FOUR slips.


## Digital Native 

Understanding the corner cutting powers of computers gave me a competitive
advantage. I was, what people would now call, 'digital native' in the stone age
of computers. A fact that I was all too eager to rub under everyone's noses at
the time.

In the third grade, I lost my computer room key privileges after a friend and I
reorganized the keys on all the 30 or IBM Model M's in the class room. 

```
QWERTYUIOP                    ABCDEFGHIJ
ASDFGHJKL                     KLMNOPQRS
ZXCVBNM                       TUVWXYZ
```

This was one of the few times in high school that I didn't cut any corners. The
alphabetizition process would take us a entire afternoon. But it proved to be
well worth the effort. The next day, all computer classes were disrupted. No
student learned to use WordPerfect or Lotus123 that day. 

At the time, my peers were far from digital native. It turned out that they
hadn't even entered the age of the typewriter. Was I to blame for their
discomfort? Up until this very day, I maintain that it's debatable.


## Lazy Santa

Even family events were not exempt from my striving to do more with less. I
think the following example tells the entire story. 

I once gave my mother a basket of old, dirty laundry as a present. I know what
you are thinking, but not even I am that mean. It was part of a dutch tradition
in which Secret Santas makes mocking gift for each other. This practice usually
consists of a lot of mediocre arts and crafting, but that's something I neither
understood nor appreciate. For me, the whole purpose of the tradition was the
mocking. The better the joke, the better the effort.

At the time, my mother just went back to art school and was constantly
complaining about her domestic tasks. So what better present than to give her
some relief from her chores? 

A week before the holiday, I wrapped up the laundry basket in wrapping paper. By
Sinterklaas evening, everyone had been complaining about missing socks and
panties for days.

Was my lack of effort bad? I would strongly argue against it. 

I don't think any other Sinterklaas gift has ever made as much of an impression
in our family.  Decades later, everyone still talks about it every year. The
annecdote has been passed on to the next generation?  Would more time and effort
have lead to equal, let alone better, results?


## The Eternal Recurrence of the Same

My attitude got a complete overhaul when I got to university. Philosophy was my
biggest passion at the time and, as such, slacking became less of a goal..
Instead, my corner cutting activities were now aimed at achieving more, not
doing less.

Most of the classes offered did not go deep and fast enough for my taste. So I
approached professors with an alternative proposal. Instead of attending their
class, I would write a paper related to the subject. Saving them of the time and
energy of having to deal with a highly critical in their classroom. Don't
remember any professor that ever refused my offer. 

Nor did anyone of them ever notice that I recycled up to 80% of earlier papers. 


## Master Teacher

My first true teacher, Willem van Reijen, was a wise man. Wise enough to realize
that he could not teach me anything anymore after I graduated. 

So when it was time for me to start the PhD, he sent me out into the world. To
his friend, Friedrich Kittler in Berlin. A man, whose fame and merits were
completely unknown to me at the time.

Friedrich Kittler is the first and only person that I have met that truly
understood the powers of computers. And I was in complete awe.

After attending his graduate seminar for two years, I finally found the courage
to ask him to read an early draft of one of my thesis chapters. A text that
comprised of a grand total of 12 pages double spaced A4.  

In response to my request, Friedrich kindly proposed the following: 

> Could you please bring it back to 3 pages?    
> And highlight the most important passages with a marker   
> Thank you!   

I was flabbergasted and even a bit insulted at the time. Now I realize that this
is the best lesson that he ever taught me. 


## Social Justice Warrior

As a teacher, I was never inclined to reward other students for effort either.
The grades that I gave were based on the results achieved, not the time that it
took them to get there.  At times, I even thought of grading systems that
penalized superfluous use of time and effort.

Of course, this lead to plenty of complaints from the self-perceived
hardworking, ambitious students: 

> It's not fair!   
> I worked 40 hours on my paper    
> And he did it in only two    

Up to the present day, I uphold that this objection doesn't even deserve an
answer. The complaint does not make any sense to me.


## Uplifting Eduction

At the time, higher education's disdain of efficiency didn't discourage me at
all. If anything, it actually fed directly into my own particular brand of OCD.
Unprofessional organizations are filled with opportunities to cut corners,
especially when it's considered a vice to do so. 

Among the experiments that I conducted as a teacher and administrator, these
were some of the most controversial ones:

+ Splitting a seminar in two smaller groups. Only offering each group a bi-weekly
session.

+ Peer grading of exams and papers.

+ Grading a group rather than the individual students in it.

+ Grading a group of students during the first session. Making all subsequent
ones optional

Honest to god, I maintain that none of these measures ever negatively affected
the quality of my teaching. On the contrary!


## Subhuman Resources

Academia was never the right environment to appreciate my antischolarly mindset.
You expect that smart people would value getting to results quickly, but the
opposite was true. Even the fact that I had the secretary making photocopies was
met with great suspicion. How stupid of me to think that there were tasks that
could be delegated to people that were hired to do them.

But an assistant professor is ill-positioned to optimize the system. So when the
chance arose, I signed up to become the Humanities department's HR Manager as a
side-hustle.

My first task was to facilitate the roll-out of the newly introduced mandatory
teaching certificate to the existing teaching staff. This measure was
anticipated with great anxiety by both staff and administration. For opposite
reasons: the staff did not want to do it, the administration wanted to have it
done. A political minefield for an inexperienced HR Manager that just started.

Asked how I would approach assessing such a great diversity of experience, my
immediate answer went along the following lines:

> Just give the certificate to them    
> Some of them have been teaching for over 20 years    
> They have proven their skills already   
> And, if not, they are not going to improve them anymore anyways

Everyone pretended to be appalled by the suggestion. Half a year later, we
actually ended up rolling out something only nominally more substantial. 

Cutting corners was the right thing to do.


## Do Repeat Myself

Despite minor victories against the bureaucratic apparatus, however, I never
felt very confident in my new role as a lazy superhero: teacher by day, HR
Manager by night. The cocktail of a hyperly optimizing mindset and an
environment heavily reluctant to be subjected to it, had been doomed from the
start. In 2012, my inevitable burn/bore out became a fact. 
 
It could not have come at a better time, since it allowed me to reconnect with a
lost love. The early 2010's, marked a true renaissance of computer literacy. And
I passionately wanted to be part of it. 

Ruby impressed me with it's clear syntax and it's thinking man's mentality.
Open Source offered a refreshing perspective on intellectual property and
collaboration. While the creative coding and data visualization community showed
me that research no longer needed to be textual.

Most importantly, the coding community was the first environment that apparently
shared my cutting corners mentality. When I first discovered that the three
great virtues of a programmer were *laziness, hybris, and impatience* I could
not have been happier. 

Everything turned full circle, when I discovered the acronomyn D.R.Y. (Do not
Repeat Yourself). I was home at last.


## Crossing Over

So I started plotting a career shift. When I read about the up and coming coding
bootcamps in Wired Magazine in the fall of 2012, I was immediately sold. This
was the kind of education that I had been looking for all my life. No years of
boring classes, but 12 weeks of highly intense training in a pressure cooking
environment. 

I signed up for Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco the same day and got accepted for
the summer cohort in 2013 a few weeks later. It felt like a chance to redeem
myself. I promised myself to do things differently this time around. No more
corner cutting, in my new career I would be an overachiever. 

In the months between enrollment and the actual program, I read, watched, and
listened to everything I could find about coding. I did not stop with the topics
offered in the curriculum either: frontend, backend, database management,
everything felt urgent and necessary. Working hard can never harm, right?

Wrong! After two only weeks of being a student, the program coordinator told me
that they I already knew everything that their curriculum covered. I have never
been more disappointed in my life. Dev Bootcamp felt sorry and promoted me to
teacher/tutor for the rest of the summer.

But I needed another teaching gig like I needed another a hole in my head. 

In hindsight, I blame it on karma. My debt for being the worst student ever
hadn't been fully repaid yet. I had to stay a teacher a few years longer.


## Cutting the Humanities

Plans changed, instead of shifting career, why not bring these insights back to
revolutionize my old one. Maybe I took 'hybris' a bit too literal?

Back at the University of Amsterdam, I believed that my newfound coding
superpowers would revitalise my academic career. Coding the Humanities was a
secret attempt to mobilize all the former dreamers and slackers into my
classroom into an army of creative coders. It worked, until it didn't.

Students were amazing. More surprisingly, administration was very supportive
too. Only problem were these same colleagues that complained about the copying.
To them, the idea of automating tasks clashed with their scholastic romanticism.
The mere idea of a computer that could release them of the boring parts and
insult to their very existence.


## Foundational Education

Offcourse was born out of my conviction that education should all be about
corner cutting. A global community of learners that didn't want to waste their
talent by engaging in month long programs and degrees. Instead, we tried to
break down to its most basic building blocks: simple todo lists of practical
tasks. Teaching them to eliminate the repetitive one function at a time.


## Ethics

Quit my job, took a couple of students with me. We are in Edtech now. But hey,
founding a startup is not difficult enough, so let's make it a value-driven,
opensource, nonprofit foundation too. 

But at least the ethical angle differentiated my activities from all others.
Waag asked me to help with this new coalition of public institution that they
were founding: Public Spaces. Apparently there was a demand for an ethical
internet. Problem, however, no one knew were to find it or how to start it. Was
I willing to help them with that?

So we're doing consultancy now? Shifting my attention to these new projects

Planet B / Bots with An Attitude

But through all of this, there is this lurking feeling that there is still an
amazing company in me somewhere. Something that brings all these things
together. Or better yet, an company that starts to eliminate all these
unnecessay laborous tasks one by one. **Cuthooks**: systematically cutting
corners since 2020.


## Learnings

Turns out that a life of corner cutting does not lead to a shorter journey after
all.

But no regrets! That's the price of learning. Question is, what lessons did I
learn. I'd say the following:

+ People need to be familiarized with the idea that cutting corners is a good
thing. We are told from a very early age that we have to suffer through laborous
tasks to succeed. In fact, our whole education system is build on this idea, It
needs a fair amount of unlearning before we can progress as a species.

+ Only optimize professional practices that are open to the idea of change.
Don't worry about the rest. They will perish soon anyways.

+ Start with low hanging fruit. There are still so many unnecessary, boring
tasks that could be automated that are now done manually, that we may not even
have the desire to automate the high hanging fruit once we get there.

+ Mechanization and automation have only produced more jobs over the last 200
years, and will continue to do so. They mostly took over tasks that were close
to slavery anyways. If anything, robotics and AI will make us more human.

+ Technology is still full of untapped potential. No Google or Facebook is
going to be close to fully utilize it any time soon. Creative tactics will
always win from all-encompassing strategies.

+ The future of AI will be local and contextual. Understanding irony should be
the new Turing Test. As long as there is no general AI that can capture all
winks and jokes  under all circumstances, there will be plenty of ways out of
surveillance capitalism. Lighten up folks!
